A new app store for Nextcloud apps built with Django. Up and running at [https://apps.nextcloud.com](https://apps.nextcloud.com). **Nextcloud integration is not handled by us**. Nextcloud integration is handled in the [Nextcloud Server repository](https://github.com/nextcloud/server).

## Documentation
Documentation including setup and API specification is [available on Read the Docs](https://nextcloudappstore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
